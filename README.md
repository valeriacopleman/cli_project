As soon as you open the program, you will see a list of characters from the show Breaking Bad. The prompt will ask the user to enter the number of the character of their choosing. After entering the number, the program will print a quote of the character, if any, and a bit of information. The program 'The Breaking Bad Lines' uses an API to gather information from a remote location. Enjoy!
